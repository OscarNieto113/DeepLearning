# Garbage Classification Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the Garbage Classification Deep Learning project. It focuses on classifying different types of garbage into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.

## Dataset Description

The Garbage Classification Dataset contains the following classes and the number of images available for each class:

- Cardboard: 393 images
- Glass: 491 images
- Metal: 400 images
- Paper: 584 images
- Plastic: 472 images
- Trash: 127 images

You can get the dataset from this kaggle repository: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. Create a deep learning model to classify garbage items into the six predefined categories.
2. Explore different deep learning techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
3. Document and explain the changes made to the model architecture and the reasons for their effectiveness.
